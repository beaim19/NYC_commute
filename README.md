# NYC_commute
These files include the codes used to download and manage data from the public NYC Taxi and Bike data in the Google Cloud Platform, and the code to create a Dashboard with RShiny: https://datatraveller.shinyapps.io/app_nyc/ . Only done for fun, I wanted to explore how taxi and bike rides are in NYC in time and location. 

The data is what it is, I have not done a study on how reliable it is.
