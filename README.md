# NYC_commute
These files include the process of downloading and managing data from the public NYC Taxi and Bike data in the Google Cloud Platform, and of managing the data to create a Dashboard with RShiny. Only done for fun, I wanted to explore how taxi and bike rides are in NYC in time and location. 

The data is what it is, I have not done a study on how reliable it is.
